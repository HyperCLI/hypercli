## API Key Authentication

Use your API key as a Bearer token:

```bash
curl https://api.hypercli.com/api/balance \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Or via `X-API-KEY` header:

```bash
curl https://api.hypercli.com/api/balance \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Getting an API Key

1. Sign up at [hypercli.com](https://hypercli.com)
2. Go to [Console](https://console.hypercli.com)
3. Create an API key

## Managing Keys

Create, list, and delete keys via the API:

```bash
# Create key
curl -X POST https://api.hypercli.com/api/keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "my-key"}'

# List keys
curl https://api.hypercli.com/api/keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"

# Delete key
curl -X DELETE https://api.hypercli.com/api/keys/{key_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## LLM API Authentication

The LLM API (`/v1/*` endpoints) uses the same API key but is OpenAI-compatible:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_HYPERCLI_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.hypercli.com/v1"
)
```
