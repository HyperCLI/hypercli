## Overview

Flows are the recommended API surface for media generation on HyperCLI.

Instead of manually choosing templates, GPUs, and regions for each request, you call a flow endpoint and HyperCLI handles the routing using defaults from infrastructure `flows.yaml`.

- Create flow jobs: `POST /api/flow/{flow_type}`
- Poll flow renders: `GET /api/flow/renders/{render_id}/status`
- Get flow catalog: `GET /flows` and `GET /flows/{flow_type}`

## Public Flow Catalog

These endpoints are public and do not require authentication:

- `GET https://api.hypercli.com/flows`
- `GET https://api.hypercli.com/flows/{flow_type}`

`/flows` returns a compact list (`name`, `path`, `price_usd`).
`/flows/{flow_type}` returns the full config for that flow (template, regions, type, pricing, etc.).

```bash
curl https://api.hypercli.com/flows
curl https://api.hypercli.com/flows/text-to-image
```

## Current Flow Prices

| Flow | Price (USD) |
|------|-------------|
| `text-to-image` | `0.10` |
| `text-to-image-hidream` | `0.10` |
| `image-to-image` | `0.10` |
| `text-to-video` | `0.25` |
| `image-to-video` | `0.25` |
| `speaking-video` | `0.25` |
| `first-last-frame-video` | `0.25` |
| `text-to-speech` | `0.05` |
| `audio-to-text` | `0.01` |

<Note>
Source of truth is infrastructure `flows.yaml`. Use `GET /flows` at runtime to avoid stale client-side price tables.

## Auth and Billing Modes

Flows support two billing/auth paths:

1. Account billing (JWT or API key)
- Endpoint family: `/api/flow/*`
- Charges your HyperCLI account balance

2. x402 pay-per-use
- Endpoint family: `/api/x402/flow/{flow_type}`
- Pays with USDC per request
- Returns a per-render access key for polling/cancel without a full account

See [x402 Top-Ups and Flow Checkout](/flows/x402).

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Account-billed flow
hyper flow text-to-image "a cinematic portrait"

# x402 pay-per-use flow
hyper flow text-to-image "a cinematic portrait" --x402
```

See [hyper flow command](/cli/commands/flow).
