Model discovery for inference should use HyperClaw endpoints.

## List Models

```bash
curl https://api.hyperclaw.app/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-..."
```

## Use a Model

```bash
curl https://api.hyperclaw.app/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "kimi-k2.5",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello"}]
  }'
```
