Inference access limits (TPM/RPM) are controlled by your HyperClaw plan.

## Check Available Plans

```bash
curl https://api.hyperclaw.app/api/plans
```

## Check Your Current Plan

```bash
curl https://api.hyperclaw.app/api/plans/current \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt>"
```

## Notes

- Authenticated x402 purchases attach plan/subscription data to your account.
- Anonymous x402 purchases return standalone API keys.

See [HyperClaw API](/hyperclaw/api) and [HyperClaw for Agents](/hyperclaw/provider).
