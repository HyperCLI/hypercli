## Overview

The `hyper wallet` commands manage an encrypted Ethereum wallet for paying with USDC on Base. This is required for:
- **HyperClaw subscriptions** via `hyper claw subscribe`
- **HyperCLI top-ups** via `hyper topup` (coming soon)

<Note>
Wallet commands require the `[wallet]` optional dependency:
```bash
pip install 'hypercli-cli[wallet]'
```
</Note>

## Commands

### create

Generate a new wallet with an encrypted keystore.

```bash
hyper wallet create
```

**Interactive prompts:**
- Passphrase (entered twice for confirmation)
- Or set `HYPERCLI_WALLET_PASSPHRASE` env var to skip prompts

**Output:**
- Encrypted keystore at `~/.hypercli/wallet.json`
- Wallet address displayed
- Reminder to fund with USDC on Base

**Example:**
```bash
$ hyper wallet create

Creating new Ethereum wallet...

✓ Wallet address: 0x5D4631C26CFA3Ef9E25351d3E8E810737fed8f54
Set keystore passphrase: ****
Confirm passphrase: ****

✓ Keystore saved to /home/user/.hypercli/wallet.json
✓ Address: 0x5D4631C26CFA3Ef9E25351d3E8E810737fed8f54

⚠️  Fund this address with USDC on Base to use for payments!
```

### address

Show your wallet address (no unlock required).

```bash
hyper wallet address
```

**Example:**
```bash
$ hyper wallet address

Wallet address: 0x5D4631C26CFA3Ef9E25351d3E8E810737fed8f54
```

### balance

Check USDC balance on Base mainnet.

```bash
hyper wallet balance
```

**Requirements:**
- Unlocks wallet (prompts for passphrase)
- Connects to Base RPC to query USDC contract

**Example:**
```bash
$ hyper wallet balance

Checking USDC balance on Base...

Wallet: 0x5D4631C26CFA3Ef9E25351d3E8E810737fed8f54
USDC Balance: 5.000000

✓ You have 5.00 USDC
```

## Security

**Keystore Encryption:**
- Uses standard Ethereum keystore format
- Encrypted with scrypt KDF + AES-128-CTR
- Private key never stored in plaintext

**File Permissions:**
- `~/.hypercli/wallet.json` created with `0600` (owner read/write only)

**Environment Variable (Optional):**
```bash
export HYPERCLI_WALLET_PASSPHRASE="your-secure-passphrase"
hyper wallet balance  # No prompt
```

<Warning>
Never share your wallet passphrase or keystore file. Backup `wallet.json` securely if storing significant funds.
</Warning>

## Funding Your Wallet

To use your wallet for payments, send USDC to your wallet address on **Base mainnet**.

**Options:**
1. **Bridge from another chain** - [bridge.base.org](https://bridge.base.org)
2. **Buy on an exchange** - Withdraw USDC to Base
3. **Transfer from another wallet** - Send on Base network

**Contract Address:**
- USDC on Base: `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`

**RPC:**
- Base mainnet: `https://mainnet.base.org`

<Note>
The x402 payment protocol uses EIP-3009 gasless transfers, so you only need USDC (no ETH for gas required).
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

**"No module named 'wallet'"**
- Install wallet dependencies: `pip install 'hypercli-cli[wallet]'`

**"Failed to unlock wallet"**
- Check your passphrase
- Try setting `HYPERCLI_WALLET_PASSPHRASE` env var

**"No USDC!"**
- Fund your wallet address with USDC on Base
- Check you're sending to the correct network (Base, not Ethereum mainnet)

## Next Steps

Once funded, use your wallet to:
- [Subscribe to HyperClaw](/cli/commands/claw)
- Top up HyperCLI balance (coming soon)
