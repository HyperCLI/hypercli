## Overview

HyperClaw is a flat-rate LLM inference API. Pay a fixed monthly subscription and get unlimited requests to any supported model through an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

**Base URL:** `https://api.hyperclaw.app/v1`

## How It Works

1. **Subscribe** to a plan on [hyperclaw.app](https://hyperclaw.app) via Stripe or USDC (x402)
2. **Create an API key** from the [dashboard](https://hyperclaw.app/dashboard/keys)
3. **Use the API** with any OpenAI-compatible client

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="sk-...",
    base_url="https://api.hyperclaw.app/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="kimi-k2.5",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

```bash
curl https://api.hyperclaw.app/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "kimi-k2.5",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

## Payment Methods

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Credit Card** | Stripe checkout from the dashboard |
| **USDC (x402)** | Pay on Base via browser wallet or `x402-wallet` CLI |

## Plans

All plans include unlimited requests. Plans differ by rate limits (TPM/RPM) and concurrent agent capacity (AIU).

Subscribe at [hyperclaw.app](https://hyperclaw.app/#pricing).

## Rate Limits

Each plan has per-team limits on:

- **TPM** — tokens per minute
- **RPM** — requests per minute

Exceeding limits returns HTTP 429. Limits reset every minute.
