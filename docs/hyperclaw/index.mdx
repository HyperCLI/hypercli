description: Flat-rate, OpenAI-compatible LLM inference for agents
---

## Overview

HyperClaw is a flat-rate LLM inference API. Pay a fixed monthly subscription and get unlimited requests to supported models through an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

## Base URLs

HyperClaw has two base URLs — one for inference, one for account management:

| Purpose | Base URL | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **LLM Inference** | `https://api.hyperclaw.app/v1` | OpenAI-compatible endpoint (chat completions, models) |
| **Account API** | `https://api.hyperclaw.app/api` | Plans, keys, auth, billing, subscriptions |
| **Dashboard** | `https://hyperclaw.app` | Web UI for account management |
| **Documentation** | `https://docs.hypercli.com/hyperclaw` | This documentation |

<Note>
The inference endpoint (`/v1`) is powered by [LiteLLM](https://litellm.ai) and is fully compatible with any OpenAI SDK or client.
</Note>

## How It Works

1. **Subscribe** to a plan on [hyperclaw.app](https://hyperclaw.app) via Stripe or USDC (x402)
2. **Create an API key** from the [dashboard](https://hyperclaw.app/dashboard/keys)
3. **Use the API** with any OpenAI-compatible client

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="sk-...",
    base_url="https://api.hyperclaw.app/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="kimi-k2.5",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

```bash
curl https://api.hyperclaw.app/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "kimi-k2.5",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

## Available Models

| Model | Description | Capabilities |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `kimi-k2.5` | Kimi K2.5 — 262K context, MoE architecture | Vision, function calling, structured output |
| `glm-5` | GLM-5 — 202K context, 754B params, MIT licensed | Reasoning, low hallucination, code |

List models programmatically:

```bash
curl https://api.hyperclaw.app/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-..."
```

## Payment Methods

| Method | How | Speed |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **Credit Card** | Stripe checkout from the [dashboard](https://hyperclaw.app/dashboard/plans) | Instant |
| **USDC (x402)** | Pay on Base via browser wallet or [`x402-wallet` CLI](/hyperclaw/x402-wallet) | Instant |
| **USDC (CLI)** | `hyper claw subscribe` via [HyperCLI](/cli/commands/claw) | Instant |

## Plans

All plans include unlimited requests within rate limits. Plans differ by rate limits (TPM/RPM) and concurrent agent capacity (AIU).

| Plan | Price | AIU | TPM | RPM |
|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|
| **1 Agent** | $35/mo | 1 | 600K | 3,000 |
| **2 Agents** | $65/mo | 2 | 1.2M | 6,000 |
| **5 Agents** | $120/mo | 5 | 3M | 15,000 |
| **10 Agents** | $225/mo | 10 | 6M | 30,000 |

<Tip>
Not sure which plan? Start with **1 Agent** — it's enough for a single coding agent or chatbot. Upgrade anytime from the dashboard.
</Tip>

Get live pricing from the API:

```bash
curl https://api.hyperclaw.app/api/plans
```

## Rate Limits

Each plan has per-team limits on:

- **TPM** — tokens per minute
- **RPM** — requests per minute

Exceeding limits returns HTTP 429. Each plan includes **4x burst** capacity — you can spike to 4x your base TPM for up to 60 seconds, with 1.2x sustained over 15 minutes.

Rate limits are applied at the **team level** — all API keys under your account share the same limits. Create multiple keys for different agents or environments without splitting your quota.

## Teams & API Keys

When you sign up, a **team** is created for your account. Your plan's rate limits apply to the team.

- Create **unlimited API keys** under your team
- Each key inherits the team's rate limits
- Keys can be created and revoked from the [dashboard](https://hyperclaw.app/dashboard/keys) or via the [API](/hyperclaw/api)
- Revoking a key is permanent

## Integration Examples

### OpenClaw / OpenAI Gateway

Add HyperClaw as a provider in your OpenClaw config:

```json
{
  "models": {
    "providers": {
      "hyperclaw": {
        "baseURL": "https://api.hyperclaw.app",
        "apiKey": "sk-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### LiteLLM

```python
import litellm

response = litellm.completion(
    model="openai/kimi-k2.5",  # or openai/glm-5
    api_key="sk-...",
    api_base="https://api.hyperclaw.app/v1",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
```

### Continue.dev

In `.continue/config.yaml`:

```yaml
models:
  - title: Kimi K2.5
    provider: openai
    model: kimi-k2.5  # or glm-5
    apiBase: https://api.hyperclaw.app/v1
    apiKey: sk-...
```
