title: x402 Wallet
description: Headless x402 checkout for HyperClaw plans using USDC on Base
---

## Overview

Use `x402-wallet` when you want to buy HyperClaw plan access without a browser checkout flow.

- Checkout endpoint: `POST https://api.hyperclaw.app/api/x402/{plan_id}`
- Token: USDC on Base
- Payment transport: x402 HTTP 402 + signed EIP-3009 payload

## Flow

1. Call `POST /api/x402/{plan_id}` without payment headers
2. Receive HTTP 402 payment requirements
3. Sign payment with your x402 wallet
4. Retry request with `X-PAYMENT` header
5. Receive `sk-...` key, expiry, and limits

## Example (curl + wallet-managed payment payload)

```bash
# Initial request (expect 402)
curl -i -X POST https://api.hyperclaw.app/api/x402/1aiu

# Retry with signed payment payload
curl -X POST https://api.hyperclaw.app/api/x402/1aiu \
  -H "X-PAYMENT: <signed-payment-payload>"
```

## Response

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "key": "sk-...",
  "plan_id": "1aiu",
  "amount_paid": "35.000000",
  "duration_days": 30.0,
  "expires_at": "2026-03-15T12:00:00+00:00",
  "tpm_limit": 600000,
  "rpm_limit": 3000
}
```

## Auth Modes

- With JWT Bearer token: account-linked subscription records
- Without JWT: standalone key issuance (anonymous x402 checkout)

See [HyperClaw API](/hyperclaw/api) for checkout semantics and duration calculation details.
