## What HyperClaw Is

HyperClaw is the dedicated inference provider for agentic workloads.

- Product site: [https://hyperclaw.app](https://hyperclaw.app)
- Inference API: `https://api.hyperclaw.app/v1` (OpenAI-compatible)
- Account/Billing API: `https://api.hyperclaw.app/api`

Use HyperClaw when your agent needs LLM inference with API keys, subscription plans, and OpenAI-compatible clients.

## Why Agents Use It

- OpenAI-compatible API surface (works with standard SDKs/tooling)
- Plan-based throughput controls (TPM/RPM)
- Checkout options:
  - Stripe (`/api/stripe/{plan_id}`)
  - x402 USDC (`/api/x402/{plan_id}`)

## Basic Agent Setup

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.hyperclaw.app/v1"
```

Then select a HyperClaw model in your agent toolchain (for example `kimi-k2.5` or `glm-5`).
