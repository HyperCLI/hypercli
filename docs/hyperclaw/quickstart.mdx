## 1. Create an Account

Sign up at [hyperclaw.app](https://hyperclaw.app) with email or wallet.

## 2. Subscribe to a Plan

From the [plans page](https://hyperclaw.app/dashboard/plans), choose a plan and pay with credit card (Stripe) or USDC on Base.

For CLI-based USDC payment, see the [x402 wallet guide](/hyperclaw/x402-wallet).

## 3. Create an API Key

Go to [API Keys](https://hyperclaw.app/dashboard/keys) and click **Create Key**. Copy the key immediately — it won't be shown again.

## 4. Make a Request

```bash
export HYPERCLAW_API_KEY="sk-..."

curl https://api.hyperclaw.app/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HYPERCLAW_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "kimi-k2.5",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is x402?"}]
  }'
```

Or with Python:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="sk-...",
    base_url="https://api.hyperclaw.app/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="kimi-k2.5",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is x402?"}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## 5. List Available Models

```bash
curl https://api.hyperclaw.app/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HYPERCLAW_API_KEY"
```

## API Keys

- Keys are scoped to your team
- You can create multiple keys (e.g. one per agent or environment)
- Revoking a key is permanent — revoked keys cannot be re-enabled
- Rename keys from the dashboard to keep track of what's what
