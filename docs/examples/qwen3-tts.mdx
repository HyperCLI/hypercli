# Qwen3 TTS — Voice Cloning on GPU

[Qwen3-TTS](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-TTS) is Alibaba's text-to-speech model with native voice cloning — give it a reference audio clip and it reproduces that voice. This guide uses our optimized container with a REST API for cloning, preset voices, and voice design.

## Requirements

- **1x L40S** (or any GPU with ≥24GB VRAM)
- Models are pre-baked in the container — no download wait

## Quick Launch

```bash
hyper jobs launch \
  --image git.nedos.co/hypercli/hyperclaw-tts:prod \
  --gpu-type L40S \
  --gpu-count 1 \
  --region se \
  --runtime 3600 \
  --interruptible \
  --auth \
  --port lb=8998 \
  --env TTS_MAX_SENTENCES=2
```

## API Endpoints

The container exposes three endpoints on port 8998:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/v1/tts` | POST | Text-to-speech with preset voices |
| `/v1/clone` | POST | Voice cloning from reference audio |
| `/v1/design` | POST | Voice design from text description (GPU only) |

## Usage

### Voice Cloning

Clone any voice from a short audio sample (5-30 seconds recommended):

```python
import requests
import base64

# Load reference audio
with open("reference_voice.wav", "rb") as f:
    audio_b64 = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode()

response = requests.post(
    "https://YOUR-HOSTNAME-gpu.hypercli.com/v1/clone",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_JOB_TOKEN"},
    json={
        "text": "This is my cloned voice speaking from a GPU in the cloud.",
        "reference_audio": audio_b64,
        "x_vector_only": True  # Prevents reference text bleeding into output
    }
)

with open("cloned_output.wav", "wb") as f:
    f.write(response.content)
```

```bash
# Encode reference audio and clone
REF_B64=$(base64 -w0 reference_voice.wav)

curl -X POST https://YOUR-HOSTNAME-gpu.hypercli.com/v1/clone \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JOB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"text\": \"Hello from the cloud.\", \"reference_audio\": \"$REF_B64\", \"x_vector_only\": true}" \
  --output cloned.wav
```

### Preset Voices

Use built-in voices without a reference clip:

```python
response = requests.post(
    "https://YOUR-HOSTNAME-gpu.hypercli.com/v1/tts",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_JOB_TOKEN"},
    json={
        "text": "Welcome to HyperCLI. Your GPU is ready.",
        "voice": "default"
    }
)

with open("output.wav", "wb") as f:
    f.write(response.content)
```

### Voice Design

Describe the voice you want in natural language:

```python
response = requests.post(
    "https://YOUR-HOSTNAME-gpu.hypercli.com/v1/design",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_JOB_TOKEN"},
    json={
        "text": "The future of computing is here.",
        "description": "A deep, calm male voice with a slight British accent"
    }
)
```

## Tips

- **`x_vector_only: true`** — Always use this for voice cloning. Prevents the reference audio's spoken text from leaking into the output.
- **`TTS_MAX_SENTENCES=2`** — Chunks input into 2-sentence batches for consistent quality. Increase for faster throughput at the cost of naturalness.
- **Reference audio quality matters.** Clean, single-speaker, 5-30 seconds. No background noise or music.
- **Output format:** WAV by default. The container handles chunking and stitching automatically.

## Performance

On a single L40S:
- **Generation speed:** ~10 seconds for a paragraph (~50 words)
- **Boot time:** ~2 minutes (models are pre-baked, no download)
- **Voice cloning:** Adds ~2 seconds for speaker embedding extraction
