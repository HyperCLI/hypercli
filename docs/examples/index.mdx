# Examples

Production-tested deployment recipes for popular models and workloads. Every example includes a one-liner launch command, API usage, and spot pricing.

## Large Language Models

<Card title="Kimi K2.5 on H200/B200" icon="brain" href="/examples/kimi-k2-5">
  Deploy Moonshot AI's 1T parameter MoE model on 8x H200 or B200 GPUs using upstream vLLM.
</Card>

## Speech & Audio

<Card title="Speaches (STT + TTS)" icon="microphone" href="/examples/speaches">
  OpenAI-compatible speech-to-text and text-to-speech in one container. Whisper + Kokoro on a single L40S.
