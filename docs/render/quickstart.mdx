## Recommended: Use Flows

```bash
# Account-billed
hyper flow text-to-image "minimalist product shot"

# x402 pay-per-use
hyper flow text-to-image "minimalist product shot" --x402
```

## Poll Status

From API:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt-or-api-key>" \
  https://api.hypercli.com/api/flow/renders/<render_id>/status
```

If launched with x402 flow checkout, use returned access key:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer hypercli_access_..." \
  https://api.hypercli.com/api/flow/renders/<render_id>/status
```

## Advanced `/api/renders`

Use direct render endpoints only when you need lower-level template control. Otherwise, prefer [Flows](/flows/index).
